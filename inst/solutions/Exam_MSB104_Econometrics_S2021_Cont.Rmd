# Part II: Regression analysis with time series data and simultanous equations models (90 minutes)

Part II consists of three subsections. Each subsection is given equal weight. It is sufficient to provide short and punctuated answers to all of the questions.

## Short questions 

1. In time series econometrics, explain the conceptual differences for the data generating process (DGP) before and after its realization.   

<div class="solution">
Formally, a sequence of random variables indexed by time is called a stochastic
process or a time series process. (“Stochastic” is a synonym for random.) When we collect a time series data set, 
we obtain one possible outcome, or realization, of the stochastic process. 
</div>

2. Explain why a contemporanous exogenous process differs from a strictly exogenous process.

<div class="solution">
The TS.3' assumption that $E(u_{t}|x_{t})=0$ implies that $u_{t}$ and the explanatory variables ($X$) are contemporaneously
uncorrelated: $Corr(x_{t,j},u_{t})= 0$ for all $j$s. $E(u_{t}|X)=0$ requires more than contemporaneous exogeneity: $u_{s,j}$ must be uncorrelated with $x_{s,j}$, even when $j\neq$i In this case we say that the explanatory variables are strictly exogenous. 
</div>

3. Assume that you detect that TS.3 is violaed but not TS.3'. Given that the other time series assumptions are satisfied, how would this impact your results?

<div class="solution">
TS.3' is sufficient for proving consistency, while violation of TS.3 implies that the OLS estimator is unabiased. As such OLS properties are only valid in large samples. 
</div>

4. Assume that you want to estimate in a time series model the impact of a lockdown on the number of hospitalized Covid patient in Italy. Given the plot below, which variable do you think should be included in such a model in order to eliminate the problem of spurious regression? 

<div class="solution">
The year-to-year plot clearly indicates that the number of Covid-patients follows a seasonal pattern. Variables that captures this should be included in order to avoid the problem of spurious regression.
</div>

5. Why do you think the year-to-year pattern of the plot from Great Britain differ such from  Italy, and how would you account for this in a time series regression model?

![](bilder/hospitcovid19gbr.png){width=50%}


<div class="solution">
The seasonal pattern seems here to be broken. This is probably due to that UK is the leading country when it comes vaciation for a large fration of its population. A variable that captures the degree of vaciation should be included in order to capture this.
</div>


6. Why are demand and supply curves (with structural interpretation) difficult to estimate when using real life data?

<div class="solution">
The equilibrium condition combined with the equation for the supply and demand curve constiute a simultanous equation (SEM) model in whichthe variable price and quantiy commonly determined. This imply endogeneity problem in the form of simulteneity problem, which implies that the SEM model can not be given a structural interpretation.
</div>

7. Is there a approach to solve this problem?

<div class="solution">
The use of IV-variabel approach: Either the demand or the supply curve need an observed variable $z_{i}$ in which changes in the value of the variable would reveal the occurnse of the other curve.
</div>

## Stochastical regression models 

We have the following AR(1) process.

\begin{equation}
y_{t}=\mu+\rho y_{t-1}+u_{t} \text{ where } u_{t}\sim N(0,\sigma^2_{u})
\end{equation}
and moving average MA(1) process:
\begin{equation}
y_{t}=\gamma+e_{t}+\theta e_{t-1} \text{ where } e_{t} \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{e})
\end{equation}


1. Find for the two model specifications above its mean and and one-period ahead forecast value

<div class="solution">
AR(1)
\begin{equation}
E(y_{t})=E(\mu + \rho (\rho y_{t-2}+ e_{t-1}) +e_{t}) = \mu + E(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \alpha^{j}(\mu+ e_{t-j}) ) = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\alpha^{j} \mu \\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
y_{t+1}=\mu + \rho y_{t}+u_{t+1} \Rightarrow E(y_{t+1}|y_{t}) = E(\mu + \rho y_{t}+e_{t+1}|y_{t})=\mu+\rho y_{t}
\end{equation}

MA(1)
\begin{equation}
E(y_{t})=E(\gamma + e_{t} + \theta e_{t-1})= \gamma    \\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
y_{t+1}=\gamma + e_{t+1}+\theta e_{t} \Rightarrow E(y_{t+1}|y_{t})=E(\gamma + e_{t+1}+\theta e_{t}) = \gamma + \theta e_{t}
\end{equation}
</div>

2. Why can't OLS be applied to the estimation to both of the model specifications?

<div class="solution">
Fitting the MA estimates is more complicated than it is in autoregressive models (AR models), because the lagged error terms are not observable. This means that iterative non-linear fitting procedures need to be used in place of linear least squares.
</div>

3. Do you think its advisable to use the model specification of the MA(1) process to model the stock market?

<div class="solution">
No, the stock market is commonly viewed to follow a Random-Walk process. If a MA(1) was the case, the estimated regression could be used as a "money-making machine" since profit would be ensured in the long run if buying under the trend and selling over the trend.  
</div>

## Application: The Phillips-Curve
Cf. appendix part II for output information.

(a) Explain the main difference between the two model specifications\

<div class="solution">
The first moel specifies the staic relationship between the impact unemployment has on the level of inflation. In the second model, the level of inflation has been replaced by the change in its inflation rate.
</div>

(b) In the diagnostic part of a time series regression model, does the output provide any clues of which specification that should be used?

<div class="solution">
Yes, $\pi$ variabel seems to be integrated of order one, while differencing it provides an I(0) variable.
</div>

(c) Interpret the results from the estimation of the coefficients and explain why the standard deviations differ in the two cases?

<div class="solution">
Solution: 
- Model 2 seems to best among the two: More significant variables, higher R-square.
- Differ: Standard differ since HAC seeks to correct for the presence of serial correlation, usually be giving higher standard deviation values.
</div>
