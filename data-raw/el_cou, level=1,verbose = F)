_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Download COVID-19 data across governmental sources at national,
     regional, and city level. Includes the time series of vaccines,
     tests, cases, deaths, recovered, hospitalizations, intensive
     therapy, and policy measures by Oxford COVID-19 Government
     Response Tracker. Provides a seamless integration with World Bank
     Open Data, Google Mobility Reports, Apple Mobility Reports.

       country = NULL,
       level = 1,
       start = "2010-01-01",
       end = Sys.Date(),
       raw = TRUE,

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 country: vector of country names or ISO codes (alpha-2, alpha-3 or
          numeric).

   level: integer. Granularity level. 1: country-level data. 2:
          state-level data. 3: lower-level data.

   start: the start date of the period of interest.

     end: the end date of the period of interest.

     raw: logical. Skip data cleaning? Default ‘TRUE’. See details.

 vintage: logical. Retrieve the snapshot of the dataset that was
          generated at the ‘end’ date instead of using the latest
          version. Default ‘FALSE’.

 verbose: logical. Print data sources? Default ‘TRUE’.

   cache: logical. Memory caching? Significantly improves performance
          on successive calls. Default ‘TRUE’.

      wb: character vector of World Bank indicator codes. See details.

     gmr: url to the Google Mobility Report dataset. See details.

     amr: url to the Apple Mobility Report dataset. See details.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     If ‘raw=FALSE’, the raw data are cleaned by filling missing dates
     with ‘NA’ values.  This ensures that all locations share the same
     grid of dates and no single day is skipped.  Then, ‘NA’ values are
     replaced with the previous non-‘NA’ value or ‘0’.

     The dataset can be extended with World Bank Open Data via the
     argument ‘wb’, a character vector of indicator codes. The codes
     can be found by inspecting the corresponding URL. For example, the
     code of the GDP indicator available at <URL:
     https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD> is
     ‘NY.GDP.MKTP.CD’. The latest data available between the ‘start’
     and ‘end’ date are downloaded.

     The dataset can be extended with Google Mobility Reports via the
     argument ‘gmr’, the url to the Google CSV file. At the time of
     writing, the CSV is available here.

     The dataset can be extended with Apple Mobility Reports via the
     argument ‘amr’, the url to the Apple CSV file. At the time of
     writing, the CSV is available here.

     Refer to this webpage for more details on the data.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Grouped ‘tibble’ (‘data.frame’). See the dataset documentation
