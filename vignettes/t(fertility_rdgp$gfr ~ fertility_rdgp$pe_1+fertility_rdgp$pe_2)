_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     ‘bgtest’ performs the Breusch-Godfrey test for higher-order serial
     correlation.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     bgtest(formula, order = 1, order.by = NULL, type = c("Chisq", "F"),
       data = list(), fill = 0)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 formula: a symbolic description for the model to be tested (or a
          fitted ‘"lm"’ object).

   order: integer. maximal order of serial correlation to be tested.

order.by: Either a vector ‘z’ or a formula with a single explanatory
          variable like ‘~ z’. The observations in the model are
          ordered by the size of ‘z’. If set to ‘NULL’ (the default)
          the observations are assumed to be ordered (e.g., a time
          series).

    type: the type of test statistic to be returned. Either ‘"Chisq"’
          for the Chi-squared test statistic or ‘"F"’ for the F test
          statistic.

    data: an optional data frame containing the variables in the model.
          By default the variables are taken from the environment which
          ‘bgtest’ is called from.

    fill: starting values for the lagged residuals in the auxiliary
          regression. By default ‘0’ but can also be set to ‘NA’.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Under H_0 the test statistic is asymptotically Chi-squared with
     degrees of freedom as given in ‘parameter’.  If ‘type’ is set to
     ‘"F"’ the function returns a finite sample version of the test
     statistic, employing an F distribution with degrees of freedom as
     given in ‘parameter’.

     By default, the starting values for the lagged residuals in the
     auxiliary regression are chosen to be 0 (as in Godfrey 1978) but
     could also be set to ‘NA’ to omit them.

     ‘bgtest’ also returns the coefficients and estimated covariance
     matrix from the auxiliary regression that includes the lagged
     residuals.  Hence, ‘coeftest’ can be used to inspect the results.
     (Note, however, that standard theory does not always apply to the
     standard errors and t-statistics in this regression.)

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list with class ‘"bgtest"’ inheriting from ‘"htest"’ containing
     the following components:

statistic: the value of the test statistic.

 p.value: the p-value of the test.

parameter: degrees of freedom.

  method: a character string indicating what type of test was
          performed.

data.name: a character string giving the name(s) of the data.

coefficients: coefficient estimates from the auxiliary regression.

    vcov: corresponding covariance matrix estimate.

          ## Generate a stationary and an AR(1) series
